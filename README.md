<b>DESCRIPTION:</b>
<br>
This is a tower defense adventure time game
with a random encounter chance. The difficulty of the monsters
you face in the encounter is randomly set. If there is an encounter,
it enters tower defense mode, also known as quest mode. This is basically
a regular tower defense minigame. At the end of the encounter, there is
a random chance to get a card or unit. Quests are redoable in a quest tab if
you want to grind to get the card. Cards can be enhanced by feeding it other
cards. Each card gives a set amount of experience points depending on its
level and rarity. Experience needed to level up gets higher per level. Higher
rarity cards need more experience to level up but their stats have better
growth.
